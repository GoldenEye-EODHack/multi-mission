            When governments began implementing shutdowns at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists wondered how the atmosphere would respond to the sudden change in human behavior. With people largely confined to their homes to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, scientists expected there were likely to be fewer cars, planes, and ships burning and emitting fossil fuels. As the pandemic has progressed, these scenarios have largely played out: during the strictest lockdown periods, locations around the world experienced substantial reductions in transportation-related fossil fuel emissions. The impacts on specific air pollutants have been varied and dependant on their lifespan in the atmosphere. Those pollutants with short lifespans, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), decreased dramatically and quickly along with emissions. Today, air quality levels are beginning to approach pre-pandemic levels, and scientists are just beginning to dive into the new measurements collected throughout this unprecedented time.

            Cities are easy to spot from space. Choose any large, urban area around the world, and you’re likely to see similar things: dense population centers, complex webs of highways and, more often than not, smog. Smog is the hazy curtain of air that often hangs over cities. It occurs when nitrogen dioxide  produced from fossil fuel emissions from gasoline in cars or coal in powerplants chemically reacts with sunlight and other pollutants like carbon monoxide (CO). Thick smog is harmful to breathe and can significantly reduce visibility. During lockdowns, satellites observed sharp reductions in nitrogen dioxide emissions in cities around the world, and smog began to vanish. Skies were bluer, air was cleaner, and, in some places, views previously obscured by air pollution were suddenly revealed. In Los Angeles, NASA scientists detected that nitrogen dioxide levels fell by more than 30% during the height of COVID-related shutdowns. Other large cities around the world experienced similar reductions.

            Nitrogen dioxide is only one component of air quality: sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), formaldehyde (CH<sub>2</sub>O), and carbon monoxide, along with a host of other atmospheric constituents, also influence the quality of the air we breathe. The difference in nitrogen dioxide is that it has a relatively short lifetime in the atmosphere; once it’s emitted, it only lasts a few hours before it disappears. Therefore, once communities entered shutdowns, and people’s mobility was severely restricted, the effect on nitrogen dioxide concentrations was the equivalent of flipping a switch. That is not, however, the case with all air pollutants.

          <p>
            Even with the strong correlation between nitrogen dioxide and the combustion of fossil fuels, atmospheric concentrations of nitrogen dioxide naturally fluctuate throughout the year, and weather patterns also influence its concentrations. For example, nitrogen dioxide typically falls dramatically during spring and summer months, and rain and wind increase its dispersion, lowering local concentrations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, NASA scientists have been able to attribute the observed changes in nitrogen dioxide to changes in our behavior, and they have been careful to account for any impacts on air pollution that are the result of natural weather variations.

            Changes in nighttime lights during the pandemic can also be tied to changes in nitrogen dioxide levels if the data are properly processed and interpreted. This is because nitrogen dioxide is primarily emitted from burning fossil fuels, and highways light up on nighttime satellite imagery when vehicles are present. Here we see the illuminated web of highways connecting the Los Angeles metropolitan region. Researchers are using night light observations to track variations in energy use, migration, and transportation in response to social distancing and shutdown measures during the pandemic.

            New research during the pandemic is also looking at how COVID-related travel bans are impacting air quality around airports. Current conditions create a unique opportunity to study airport-related pollutants, especially nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde. While travel bans and strict regulations around air travel have been in place, air traffic has yet to return to previous levels, and many planes remain grounded.

            After the initial shock of COVID-related shutdowns in the spring, communities worldwide began to reopen and gradually increase mobility. Cars returned to the road, and travel restrictions slowly eased. These resumptions corresponded with relative increases in nitrogen dioxide levels and other air pollutants, as air quality levels began to return to pre-pandemic levels. This demonstrates how quickly atmospheric nitrogen dioxide responds to reductions in emissions. They will persist as long as emissions persist and decline rapidly if emissions are reduced. NASA scientists will continue to monitor nitrogen dioxide levels and long-term trends around the world. NASA is expected to launch its{' '}
