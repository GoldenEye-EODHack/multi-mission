          Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have implemented, eased, and re-implemented restrictions limiting mobility and international travel to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. As a result, people have largely stayed home, and the ways in which we interact with the human-made and natural environments have changed. These changes have reverberated throughout Earth’s systems and are observed in different ways by NASA satellites.

            When China implemented restrictions on businesses in the early months of 2020, NASA researchers documented changes in nighttime lights throughout the region. Images of Earth at night provide an extraordinary view of how human activity changes over time. During the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists are using satellite observations to track variations in nighttime lights, which show changes in transportation, energy use, and migration as human response to the pandemic evolves. From January through February 2020, nighttime lights in the central commercial district of Wuhan dimmed as people stayed home instead of shopping or socializing. Even highways, represented by the bright lines in the satellite imagery, darkened with less activity during shutdown periods.

          At different stages of the pandemic, nonessential businesses like shopping malls closed temporarily, while essential businesses like grocery stores were allowed to remain open. The effect of nonessential business closures on surface transportation around the world was so significant that it could be seen from space. For example, the imagery shown here provides a stark picture of empty parking lots near deserted commercial districts in and around Los Angeles. Blue areas represent places where slowdowns were most severe. Scientists obtained these data by combining remote sensing technology known as synthetic aperture radar, or SAR, with high-resolution imagery from Planet Labs. By comparing SAR images of the same areas before and after pandemic-related lockdowns, decreases in car activity in Los Angeles near airports, sports stadiums, and shopping malls were visible from space.

          It wasn’t just ground transportation in Los Angeles that was affected by COVID-related shutdowns – its port also showed less activity. During the pandemic, supply chains around the world dependent on cargo shipping saw interruptions as many ports closed, shipments canceled, and in some locations, altered routes prevented the efficient movement of cargo. According to the Port of Los Angeles, its port saw a 19% reduction in shipping cargo volume during the early months of the pandemic, compared to the same time period in 2019. The image here shows a reduction in the number of ships at the port, which could potentially also affect the area’s overall water quality.

            Satellite and thermal data also showed how the decreases in air pollution and the prevalence of empty parking lots during the pandemic changed how much solar radiation is absorbed and reflected from ground surfaces. Cleaner air meant that heat re-emitted during the day from dark asphalt and cement surfaces did not stay trapped near the ground as long.

            Limits on work and travel during the pandemic also affected how humans interact with the natural environment. For example, satellites observed a reduction in managed forest fires, otherwise known as prescribed burns, on federal lands. Prescribed burns are an important way to reduce fuel loads and maintain biodiversity. In March 2020, the U.S. Forest Service and other federal agencies temporarily suspended all prescribed burns on federal lands in the Southeast United States. State agencies in Mississippi, South Carolina, and North Carolina also issued spring burning bans in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Forest Service’s suspension aimed to prevent virus exposure to employees and to reduce smoke exposure to vulnerable communities, since COVID-19 is a respiratory illness.
