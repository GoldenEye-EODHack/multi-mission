              Food supply flows and food access across the globe have been

              during the novel coronavirus pandemic.

                  Governments and agricultural organizations typically rely on
                  in-person surveys to track key farming milestones like sowing,
                  crop progress, and harvesting. Due to social distancing
                  measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, groups are increasingly
                  relying on satellite Earth observations to safely track these
                  variables.

                  Despite these common obstacles, the spread of the novel
                  coronavirus has unevenly impacted global food supply chains.
                  In higher income countries with more isolated agricultural
                  communities and less intensive cultivation techniques, the
                  virus&apos;s spread has had a minimal effect on key staple crops
                  like wheat, maize, rice, and soybeans. Yet, in some middle
                  and lower income countries where mandatory shelter-in-place
                  orders have strained the cultivation of labor-intensive
                  crops, the U.N. World Food Programme estimates that the
                  pandemic could double the number of people facing acute
                  food shortages by the end of 2020.

                Researchers use a variety of methods to assess crop conditions,
                including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),
                precipitation, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and
                temperature. Each of these aspects can be observed using
                satellites.
              </p>
              <p>
                NDVI is used to monitor the amount of healthy vegetation in a
                study area. Healthy vegetation reflects more near-infrared
                wavelengths and absorbs more red and blue light – this is why
                healthy vegetation appears green to the human eye. Changes in
                NDVI tell us when vegetation is consistently healthy over a
                specific time frame or season. Precipitation anomaly datasets
                provide an idea of which areas are experiencing too much or too
                little rain for crops to survive. Soil Moisture maps show how
                much water is being stored in the soil. If the soil-water ratio
                is balanced, crops will be able to take root more easily than
                in drier conditions. Evapotranspiration, or the evaporation of
                water from plants and the land surface, is measured using the{' '}

                drought in a region. And temperature is an important factor to
                assess crop growth because certain crops have specific
                temperature thresholds. Monitoring temperature anomalies helps
                indicate whether temperatures are too warm or cold over time
                for a crop to thrive.

                  Within the GEOGLAM Crop Monitor data, each timestep shows the
                  global synthesis crop condition map of all crops being
                  monitored. Each color represents a different crop condition.
                  Blue is “Exceptional,” where crop conditions are much better
                  than average. This label is used only during the
                  grain-filling through harvest stages. Green is favorable,
                  where crop conditions range from slightly below to slightly
                  above average at reporting time. Yellow is Watch, where crop
                  conditions are not far from average but there is a potential
                  risk to final yields. There is still time and possibility
                  for the crop to recover to average conditions if the ground
                  situation improves. This label is only used during the
                  planting through early vegetative and the vegetative through
                  reproductive stages. Red is “Poor,” where conditions are well
                  below average. Crop yields in red regions are likely to be
                  10% below average. This is only used when conditions are not
                  likely to be able to recover and an impact on yields is
                  likely. Gray areas are where crops are out-of-season, and
                  brown areas are where there is no reliable source of data
                  available.

                  The Crop Monitor for AMIS has shown that crop conditions and
                  the related production for 2020 are generally favorable.
                  While dry conditions in parts of Europe, southern Ukraine,
                  and southern Russia have impacted winter wheat yields,
                  favorable harvests in North America, India, China, and
                  elsewhere in the Black Sea region have offset those
                  reductions. In the Southern Hemisphere, there have been good
                  harvests of maize and soybeans in Brazil, Argentina, and
                  South Africa. Looking ahead, conditions are favorable for
                  most summer crops in the Northern Hemisphere, the monsoon
                  season in India, the main rice season in northern southeast
                  Asia, and for winter wheat in Australia. Providing evidence
                  from satellite-based observations that overall global
                  production of major staple crops is adequate has been
                  critical during this time of uncertainty.
